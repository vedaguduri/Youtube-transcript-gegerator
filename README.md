Description
This Python script automates the process of downloading the audio from a YouTube video, transcribing it using OpenAI's Whisper model, detecting the language of the transcription, and saving the transcription to a text file, which is then automatically opened. The script ensures that FFmpeg, a multimedia framework needed for audio processing, is installed and accessible.

Modules Used:
os: Handles interaction with the operating system, such as managing file paths and running system commands.
whisper: Provides the functionality to transcribe audio into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
langdetect: Detects the language of the transcribed text.
pytube: Facilitates downloading videos and audio streams from YouTube.
subprocess: Executes system-level commands and checks if FFmpeg is installed and accessible.
Key Functions:
check_ffmpeg(): Verifies if FFmpeg is installed and accessible from the system's PATH. If not, it exits the script with an error message.
startfile(fn): Opens a file using the default program associated with its file type on the user's operating system.
create_and_open_txt(text, filename): Creates a text file with the provided content and filename, then opens it.
Workflow:
Set FFmpeg Path: Adds the FFmpeg binary location to the system PATH environment variable.
Check FFmpeg Installation: Calls check_ffmpeg() to ensure FFmpeg is installed.
YouTube URL Input: Prompts the user to input a YouTube video URL.
Download Audio: Uses PyTube to download the audio stream of the video in MP3 format.
Transcribe Audio: Loads the Whisper model and transcribes the downloaded audio.
Detect Language: Uses langdetect to identify the language of the transcribed text.
Save and Open Transcription: The transcribed text is saved into a .txt file, named according to the detected language, and is automatically opened.
Purpose:
This script is useful for automating the process of extracting and transcribing audio from YouTube videos, especially for generating text transcriptions in different languages. It leverages multiple libraries to handle the video download, audio processing, transcription, and language detection efficiently.
